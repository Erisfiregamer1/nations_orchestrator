Nations is a Discord-based game based on warfare, deception, and economy-building.

Your goal is to take over the world or die trying. You own a country and control all the civilians within with an iron fist. With this, can you take over everyone else with the same goals?

The game works as following:

- Every month, a game begins. You have until the end of the month to take over the world. Failing that, whoever has the most Economy wins.
- There is a 3-day sign-up period at the start of every month. Everyone who signs up chooses a name and gets a country on the world map, as well as a porportional amount of Civilians and Economy to start with.
- Economy is used for EVERYTHING- weapons, soldiers, getting more economy, surviving attacks... If you run out, it's game over and your country collapses, becoming Uncontrolled territory where anyone can claim.
- Every day, you make decisions on what to do the NEXT day- making more factories or homes to earn more money or hold more civilians, spend economy to recruit and gear up Soldiers to fight other countries, or fire bombs that can destroy entire countries in a few turns. You are also told what happened on the events of the previous day and how much Economy you now have to use.
- If you manage to destroy a country with your army by causing them to run out of Economy, you instantly take them over and gain whatever remaining Civilians they had. If you destroy a country with a bomb, you have to take another turn to take over their country- though there might not be any remaining civilians after the fact.
- After 5 days, you unlock Planes to attack countries not next to you (you can attack countries 1-2 hops away). After 20 days, Weapons of Mass Destruction (atom bombs) are unlocked for country-wide devestation, but they come at a severe economy and civilian price!
- If you manage to take over every single country, you win and get a special token on your Nations profile for any future games! The more you win, the more tokens you can get.



FUTURE PLANS FOR AFTER HACK CLUB:
- Betting system? Bet on a country to win Nations, the people who voted for the winner get a split of all the bets between everyone else who voted for the winner
- Some way for the audience to interact. Firing bombs? Economy theft?
